# Set a Default Tour

Learn how to set up a default tour for easier gig management.

## Why Set a Default Tour?

The default tour is the cornerstone for all gig related data beeing displayed to you through the application.  For instance, your calendar and tour routes.  They will only display events and stops related to the default tour.  This way your information is neatly organized to help avoid confusion.  
You can create as many tours as you'd like.  There is no limit. 

Not all things are related to a tour.  For instance, Saved Venues and Leads are not tied to a tour.  They are saved to your account and can be utilized independently of a tour.

Now that we have a tour, we can start adding our tour stops in the gig caleendar.
